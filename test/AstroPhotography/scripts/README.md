# Scripts Used For AstroPhotography Testing

These are primarily resources used to generate expected values
for the python AstroPhotography unit tests, or otherwise verify
the python code functionality.

They require the use of Octave compiled with 16-bit quantum 
GraphicsMagick. They may work with Matlab as-is, or with minimal 
modification.
